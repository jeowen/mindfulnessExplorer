Mindfulness Coach was a collaborative effort between the VA’s National Center for PTSD and the DoD’s National Center for Telehealth and Technology.

The National Center for PTSD, within the Department of Veterans Affairs, aims to help U.S. veterans and others through research, education, and training on trauma and PTSD.

The National Center for Telehealth and Technology |T2| researches, develops, evaluates, and deploys new and existing technologies for Psychological Health (PH) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) across the Department of Defense (DoD).
  
T2 is a component center of the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCoE), which leads a collaborative global network to promote the resilience, recovery and reintegration of Warriors and their families who face psychological health and traumatic brain injury issues.
